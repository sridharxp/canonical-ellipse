Complex no is associated with two dimensions in complex plane.

It can represent multi dimensional information.
If so will n dimension compatible with n-1 dimension?
Yes, there is way.

Normally n dimension means n axes each orthogonal each other.
In n-1 dimension each of n axes would be 120 degrees to each other.
So three dimensional axes would become in a plane three axes each 120 degrees to others
Four dimensional axes transforms to something like tripod
Also importantly we can eliminate one axis  at a time and make the remaining axes orthogonal to each other.
So three dimension becomes three axes in a plane and two constructed axes. But the two axes have the info of the third.
x, y, z become x-y and x-y.

1. CIRCLE becomes ELLIPSE
This is rom very simple arithmetic using complex no
2.Peternion like Quaternion

New functions and curves; More importantly new ways of looking at them.
